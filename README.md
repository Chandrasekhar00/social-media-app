## Technologies Used:
### Frontend:
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**
- **React.js**: UI Library
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for routing and handling requests.
- **MongoDB**: Database to store users, posts, and messages.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **JWT**: Authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
- **bcryptjs**: For password hashing.
- **Socket.io**: Real-time communication for messaging.

## Installation:

### 1. Clone the Repository:
Clone this repo to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-media-app.git
cd social-media-app
2. Install Backend Dependencies:
Navigate to the backend folder and install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Here are the essential backend packages:

express: Web framework for handling requests and routing.
mongoose: MongoDB object modeling.
jsonwebtoken: JSON Web Token for authentication.
bcryptjs: Password hashing.
cors: Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
Install them with:

bash
Copy code
npm install express mongoose jsonwebtoken bcryptjs cors
3. Install Frontend Dependencies:
Navigate to the frontend folder and install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm install
Here are the essential frontend packages:

react: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
axios: HTTP client for making API requests.
react-router-dom: React library for routing.
redux (optional, for state management): A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
socket.io-client: For real-time messaging.
Install them with:

bash
Copy code
npm install react axios react-router-dom redux socket.io-client
4. Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in both backend and frontend directories to manage environment-specific variables.

Backend .env:
env
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your-mongo-db-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
Frontend .env:
env
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
Make sure to replace your-mongo-db-connection-string and your-secret-key with your actual MongoDB connection URI and secret key for JWT.

5. Start the Application:
Backend:
To run the server, navigate to the backend folder and start it in development mode using nodemon:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm run dev
This will start the backend on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend:
To start the frontend, navigate to the frontend folder and run:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
This will start the frontend on http://localhost:3000.

### Notes:
1. **Essential Packages**: The `README` now includes a clear list of packages for both frontend and backend.
2. **Environment Configuration**: Make sure the MongoDB URI and JWT secret are added to the `.env` files.
3. **Start Commands**: The `npm run dev` for backend (with `nodemon`) and `npm start` for React frontend ensure smooth local development.
